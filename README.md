# Systems Project2 - MyShell

**1. Group Members:** Jason Liu, Stanley Huang, Julien Zhang

**2. Creative Group Name:** Put Something In I Don't Know

**3. Successful Features:** 
- Prompting user for input and reading from stdin
- Parsing the argument
- Forking and having the child execvp the command
- Supporting use of semicolons to type multiple commands in one line
- Getting cd to work properly
- Printing the path before the prompt
- Shortening the path to replace the home directory with ~
- Quitting the shell using the exit command or by pressing ctrl + D
- Commands with 1 redirection operator (either > or <)
- Commands with 1 pipe (|) using a temp file
- Taking commands from a text file and running them (./shell < lines.txt)

**4. Attempted Unsuccessful Features:**

**5. Known Bugs:**
- When using a text file as input for ./shell the print format is weird, some line breaks are missing and multiple commands in one line causes weird print orders (especially with cd involved)

**6. Other Comments:**

**7. Function Headers:**
- shell.c: int main();
- input.c: char *takeInput();
- path.c: void printPath();
- execute.c: void parse_args( char * line, char ** arg_ary ); void cd(char* path); void execute(char* string);
- redirect.c: void stdoutRedirExec(char* path, char* args[]); void stdinRedirExec(char* path, char* args[]); void PipeRedirExec(char* args[], int pipeLocation, int argsLen); int redir(char* args[], int argsLen);
